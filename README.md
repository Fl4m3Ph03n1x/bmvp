To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Run `mis assets.deploy` to prepare the assets for use
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

This projects needs PSQL database. You can also use docker for that:

  * Run `docker compose up -d` to create and run a detached temporary DB.
